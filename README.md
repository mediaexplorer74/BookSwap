# BookSwap - My fork of "A Xamarin.Forms UI Challenge" by Kim Phillpotts
My main goal is to research "veeery rich" BookSwap app architecture via adding UWP target.

## RnD status / My 2 cents
- Shared project switched from .NETStandard 2.0 to 1.4.
- iOS target disabled/deleted; UWP target added (19041/15063).
- UWP App compiled normally.
- UWP App started. Splashscreen ok.
- UWP App crashed. I have no idea what's happen... so strange. Can't debug... the app decomposition needed.

## Contributions
- All the designs I implement are intended to be for learning more about techniques to create beautiful Xamarin.Forms interfaces. 
- I welcome pull requests and suggestions to improve the solution. Please just raise an issue or submit a pull request.
- Feel free to take this code and do what you will, but please make sure you acknowledge myself and also the original designer.
